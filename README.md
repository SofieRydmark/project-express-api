# Project Express API

This is a backend project using Express API and locally stored json file. My project is using a json file showing books.

Routes created for API:

- /books <br/>
Show all books <br/>
- /books/:id <br/>
Show a book by its id (1-1461) <br/>
- /books/titles/:title <br/>
Show books by title or that includes a word in title you want to see. Ex Harry Potter <br/>
- /authors <br/>
Sort out authors with their books <br/>
- /authors/:name <br/>
Show an author by name or includes a name. Ex Rowling <br/>
