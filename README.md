# Project Express API

This is a backend project using Express API and locally stored json file. My project is using a json file showing books.

Routes created for API:

/books : Show all books <br/>
/books/:id : Show a book by its id (1-1461) <br/>
/books/titles/:title : Show books by title or that includes a word in title you want to see. Ex Harry Potter <br/>
/authors : Sort out authors with their books <br/>
/authors/:name : Show an author by name or includes a name. Ex Rowling <br/>
